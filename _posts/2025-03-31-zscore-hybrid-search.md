In search engines and machine learning, **data normalization** is essential for making fair and accurate comparisons between different features or scores.  

**Hybrid queries** use multiple normalization techniques to prepare final results. The two main types are **score-based normalization** and **rank-based combination**. In score-based normalization, the default method—**min-max normalization**—doesn't handle outliers well. *(Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the rest of a dataset. In techniques like min-max scaling and z-score normalization, outliers can greatly impact results.)*  

In this blog post, we'll introduce **z-score normalization**, a technique added in OpenSearch 3.0-beta1. We'll explore what it is, why it matters, and how OpenSearch uses it.  

## What is z-score normalization?

_Z-score normalization_, also known as _standardization_, is a method of scaling data using mean and standard deviation. The formula for calculating the z-score is:

Z = (X - μ) / σ,

where:

* X is the original value.
* μ is the population mean.
* σ is the standard deviation of the population.

## When to use z-score normalization

Your index's structure can help you decide which normalization technique to use, as each has its own advantages. If your documents are highly similar and a typical query returns top-k results that are closely clustered together within the index (as shown in the following graph), min-max normalization may be the better choice.

However, z-score normalization is a better choice if the results are more evenly distributed and follow a pattern similar to a normal distribution, as shown in the following graph.

The basic process for choosing between min-max and z-score normalization is outlined in the following diagram.

## How to use z-score normalization

To use z-score normalization, create a search pipeline and specify `z_score` as the `technique`:

```json
PUT /_search/pipeline/z_score-pipeline
{
    "description": "Zscore processor for hybrid search",
    "phase_results_processors": [
        {
            "normalization-processor": {
                "normalization": {
                    "technique": "z_score"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Next, create a hybrid query and apply the pipeline to the query:

```json
POST my_index/_search?search_pipeline=z_score-pipeline
{
   "query": {
     "hybrid": [
         {}, // First Query
         {}, // Second Query
         ... // Other Queries
     ] 
   }
}
```

## Benchmarking z-score normalization performance

Benchmark experiments were conducted on an OpenSearch cluster with one **r6g.8xlarge** instance as the coordinator node and three **r6g.8xlarge** instances as data nodes. To evaluate z-score normalization comprehensively, we measured two key metrics across five distinct datasets.  

For more information about the datasets used, see [Datasets](https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/thakur/BEIR/datasets/).

Search relevance was quantified using the industry-standard normalized discounted cumulative gain at rank 10 (NDCG@10). We also tracked system performance using search latency measurements. This setup provided a strong foundation for evaluating both search quality and operational efficiency.


### NDCG@10

The following table compares NDCG@10 scores for hybrid search using min-max normalization and z-score normalization, showing the percent difference in search relevance across five datasets.

### Conclusions

Our benchmark experiments highlight the following advantages and trade-offs of using z-score normalization compared to min-max normalization in hybrid search:

- **Search quality (measured using NDCG@10 across four datasets)**:

  * Z-score normalization shows a modest improvement in search quality, with an average increase of 2.08% in NDCG@10 scores.
  * This suggests that z-score normalization may provide slightly better search result relevance compared to the default min-max normalization.


- **Latency impact**:

  * Z-score normalization shows a small increase in latency across different percentiles, as shown in the following table.

  |Latency percentile	|Percent difference	|
  |---	|---	|
  |p50	|0.70%	|
  |p90	|0.50%	|
  |p99	|0.50%	|

  * The positive percentages indicate that z-score normalization has slightly higher latency compared to min-max normalization, but the differences are minimal (less than 1% on average).

- **Trade-offs**:

  * There's a slight trade-off between search quality and latency. Z-score normalization offers an improvement in search relevance (2.08% increase in NDCG@10) at the cost of a marginal increase in latency (0.50% to 0.72% across different percentiles).

- **Overall assessment**:

  * Z-score normalization provides a modest improvement in search quality with a negligible impact on latency.
  * The choice between z-score and min-max normalization may depend on your use case. If search relevance is a priority, z-score normalization may be the better option, especially if your system can tolerate a small latency increase.

These findings suggest that z-score normalization can be a viable alternative to min-max normalization in hybrid search, particularly when optimizing search relevance is a priority and the system can tolerate minimal latency increases.

## What's next?

We're continuing to enhance OpenSearch's hybrid search capabilities beyond z-score normalization by implementing **custom normalization functions**. These will enable you to define your own normalization logic and allow fine-tuning of search result rankings. This enhancement will provide you more control over search result ranking while ensuring reliable and consistent hybrid search outcomes.
